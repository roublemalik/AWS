AWS Fundamentals

Greetings!

I am Rouble Malik.

I am an IT professional of over 5+ years of experience in Network Security, Cloud Computing and Cyber Security.

I am a Certified:
1. AWS Security Specialty Certified
2. Fortinet - Network Security Expert
3. CCNA Security
4. CCNP - R&S
5. CCNA - R&S

I am working towards my AWS Security Specialty certification. 

I love to learn and love to team others. This has encouraged me to take over writing articles, blogging and publication. My writing currently focuses on AWS Security, AWS architecture and anything that touches AWS. 

I wish for your support and wish you good luck as well.

Thank you for your support.

Love!
